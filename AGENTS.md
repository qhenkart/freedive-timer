App Description

This app is a fully client-side, browser-based visual timer that allows users to:
	•	Set a custom total countdown time (in seconds).
	•	Add any number of sound triggers at exact time points during the countdown.
	•	Choose for each trigger between three default sounds (ding, beep, long beep) or upload a custom audio file (which is stored in-memory, not uploaded to any server).
	•	View a large, modern visual timer display that updates every second.
	•	All audio and configuration is handled entirely in the browser—no backend, no persistent storage, no data leaves the user’s device.


All code updates must have tests, any bug fixes must have tests. 

run tests, lint before submitting
